This is the gbm frontend used by (for example) weston compositor to
load the GLES stack, and retrieve the backing buffer objects behind
an eglImage (created with EGL_WAYLAND_BUFFER_WL), etc.

The frontend is really just a backend loader and shim.  The backend
library must be provided by the GLES implementation.
